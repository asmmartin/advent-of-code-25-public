Repository with the challenges of
[Advent of Code 2025](https://adventofcode.com/2025) solved by me using Python
😁. Another year that I was able to complete the daily challenges 100% on time
😎.

> Disclaimer: I have solved these challenges for fun and as practice.
> Additionally, I have been working on them from time to time. It's possible
> that I haven't always followed the best practices, that the style is not
> consistent between challenges, and there might even be some errors. They may
> not represent the optimal solutions, but they are the ones I found as I solved
> them. I have approached them with a casual -not 100% professional- mindset.
